  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Jagadish Chandra Bose was an Indian physicist, biologist, botanist, and a pioneer in the investigation of radio and microwave optics. 
  He was also the first to demonstrate that plants respond to external stimuli — a revolutionary idea at the time. 
  His life and work remain a source of inspiration for generations of scientists and inventors.</p>

  <h2>Early Life</h2>
  <p>He was born on November 30, 1858, in Mymensingh, Bengal Presidency (present-day Bangladesh). 
  He studied in Calcutta and later went to the University of Cambridge to study natural sciences. 
  After returning to India, he became a professor at Presidency College, Calcutta.</p>

  <h2>Timeline of Important Events</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1858:</strong> Born in Mymensingh, Bengal.</li>
